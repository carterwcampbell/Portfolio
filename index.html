                    <section>
                        <p><strong>Hi! I'm Carter Campbell </strong>I am a recent graduate from Colorado State University in the class of 2020. I am an entry level computer scientist looking for my first step in an exciting career in software development and engineering. Right now, I am looking for any job opportunity in the software industry to get my first hands on experience in the world.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>My biggest passion outside of software is running. I started running when I was in the eighth grade, and haven’t stopped since. I love spending part of my day out on the roads, trails, or mountains to forget about everything around me. I love competing in local road races ranging from 5k to half marathons. Feel free to check out my first ever website I designed from scratch <a href="running.html">here</a> which is all about my running career.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>In terms of software, I have a large interest in game development and design. I have been playing games for the better part of my life, and they are what inspired me to pursue game development. Not only do I enjoy games in general, I believe they serve as an escape from the real world, and the hardships it can bring from time to time. I would love to be a member of a team that impacts a person’s life for the better through the power of games.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>This leads into my passion for software development. Seeing and experiencing the difference that video games can have on an individual, my eyes and mind were opened to the impact technology as a whole can make on our entire society. I realized that I am pursuing this career not because it’s cool, or because it may pay a lot, but because of the difference it can make. From launching rockets and satellites into space, to developing technology to save lives, to simply playing a character in a large open world, technology can make an impact to change people’s lives. I am looking for an opportunity to do just that. Make a real difference in today’s society.</p>
